== Description ==

The 1-Click Login WordPress plugin is a simple and secure passwordless authentication service. Imagine a world where your users are free to securely come and go from anywhere on your website without a password. We are passionate about the freedom that comes with eliminating passwords—and we believe you will be, too, once you download and install 1-Click Login: Passwordless Authentication.

**What is 1-Click Login?**

1-Click Login is the easiest way for your users to access your content. 
We’ve eliminated the hassle of the password so more people will use your app. 

**Who Is 1-Click Login For?**

1-Click Login is for anyone who wants to simply and securely eliminate passwords from their website. If you’re reading this description, you should install the 1-Click Login plugin to secure the administration of your WordPress website.

But why stop there? 1-Click Login is perfect for eliminating passwords from your user registration and login process entirely. Here are a few of the ways we’ve seen others find success with 1-Click Login.

- **WordPress Website Developers:** Make your life easier by installing 1-Click Login on each of your websites so you can securely access each web property with one click.

- **Digital Marketers:** Sales is going to love you after installing 1-Click Login. Provide verified emails that you know work with every registration.

- **Conversion Rate Optimizers:** Reduce registration form abandonment rates by eliminating a “required” password field.

- **Product Designers:** Incorporate 1-Click Login into your registration and login process for a friction-free experience. Less steps. More secure. More access.

- **Bloggers:** Register your visitors with ease and provide a frictionless paywall for your gated content.

- **CISO:** Passwords are insecure. That’s why our technology is being used by some of the most well-known technology companies.

- **Customer Success & Support Managers:** Never reset a password again. Eliminate low-value/high-cost call center calls, emails and chats, and enable the resources you have to focus on high-value activities that can really help your customers succeed.

**Why 1-Click Login?**

Passwords are antiquated and insecure. At this point, we’ve all had our passwords hijacked by hackers. So what are we left with? Continue to recycle a series of passwords we can easily remember? Use a password vault to store unique passwords for each website? Or, we can eliminate the password problem entirely with 1-Click Login.

1-Click Login also helps you:

**Convert.**

-   Increasing customer acquisition can be challenging. With 1-Click Login, you’ll increase visitor conversion by eliminating passwords from your registration process.

**Verify.**

-   No more bots. 1-Click Login only accepts verified user email accounts, producing higher-quality signups and submissions to help you to know who your users are.

**Secure.**

-   Patented authentication protocol leverages a combination of DKIM, SPF and our own special sauce to ensure the integrity of each authentication request.
-   1-Click Login replaces the centralized storage of passwords with digital signatures and tokenized authentication.
-   With no passwords to get hacked or compromised, organizations dramatically reduce their liability caused by data breaches and phishing scams.


**Access.**

-   1-Click Connect makes secure authorization a breeze for returning users.
-   With 1-Click Login configured on your site, you’ll never reset a password again.

**How It Works:**

1.  Download, install and configure the plugin in about 5 minutes.
2.  We automatically add the “Log in with 1-Click” button to your WP admin login page. This is great for internal/external access to administer your WordPress site.
3.  Add the “Log in with 1-Click” button anywhere you want with a short code `[swoop_login]`.
4.  You can also add the 1-Click Login service to any call to action by following the instructions in our [developer documentation](https://docs.swoopnow.com/).
5.  The “Log in with 1-Click” button calls out to the 1-Click Login authentication service to enable passwordless access to your WordPress account and website.


After initial authorization, 1-Click Login will securely cookie your end users if you’ve enabled 1-Click Connect authorization on your website. The next time your end users return to your website, they’ll be able to authenticate by selecting the email address that’s registered with your site—in just one click.

*Privacy Policy*
1-Click Login does not store any of your user’s data, we simply authenticate user’s email addresses and WordPress directs the user to your content. 1-Click Login does not use the user’s email addresses for marketing purposes. For more information on 1-Click Logins terms of service and privacy policy please visit our [legal page](https://swoopnow.com/legal/).

**Protected Pages for Gated Content:**
With 1-Click Login, you can also protect any page in your WordPress site without passwords. The 1-Click Login Protected Page feature allows you to control who can view or access content on a specific page within your site, such as a private blog post or resource download page. 1-Click Login’s email-based authentication lets you grant select access to your content without making your site visitors create (and forget) yet another password.
